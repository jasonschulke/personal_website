            Why I Built This
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-7 text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400">
            Apple Invites looks great, but everyone you invite needs an iPhone. I
            was putting together something for my daughter&apos;s dance recital
            and half the family is on Android, so that ruled it out immediately.
            The other options I tried were buried in ads, or wanted guests to
            make an account before they could say &ldquo;yes, I&apos;ll be
            there.&rdquo;
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-7 text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400">
            So I built the smaller, friendlier version I wanted. Open the link,
            tap a button, done.

            How It Works
          </h2>

          <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-7 text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400">
            Setting up an event takes about a minute. I sign in with a PIN, pick
            a cover photo, and fill in the date, venue, and a short description.
            The invite previews as I type, so I can see exactly what guests will
            see.
          </p>

            src={createImg}

            alt="Building and previewing an event in Hootenanny"
            caption="The editor, with a live preview of the invite."
          />

          <p className="mt-8 text-base leading-7 text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400">
            Once it&apos;s ready I get two links. One collects RSVPs, for the
            people I actually need a headcount from. The other just shows the
            details, which is handy for the group chat where nobody needs to
            formally reply. Either link opens on any device, and guests respond
            with their name and how many people they&apos;re bringing.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-7 text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400">
            Responses land on a host dashboard. I can see who&apos;s in,
            who&apos;s still deciding, and who can&apos;t make it, plus party
            sizes and whatever notes people leave behind.

            The name came first. A hootenanny is an old word for an informal
            get-together, and once I had it, the owl was pretty much
            unavoidable. Everything else followed from there. The palette is all
            browns, creams, and tans, which felt right for something closer to a
            handwritten note than a dashboard. The wordmark is set in Lily
            Script One and the body text is Nunito. There are owl puns hiding in
            the empty states if you go looking.
